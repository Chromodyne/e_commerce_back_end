## Description ##

A functional back-end database is a critical part of any business that engages in e-commerce as the ability to track inventory
and other essential items is paramount. 

With this application you can easily set up a MySQL database schema as well as seed information into the database for your business.
The app also responds to API requests using the Express JS node package. The user may use the GET, PUT, and DELETE API requests to get, update, 
and destroy database items respectively. The requests also accept parameters of the database items ID so that each
item can be individually requested and retrieved, deleted, or modified.
